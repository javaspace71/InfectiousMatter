					<p>
						Let's put aside the argument whether viruses are alive or not for a second, and instead focus on one of their most important life-like characteristics: <b>Evolution</b>.  
					</p>

				    <p>

				    </p>

					<p>
						Evolution is one of those deceptively tricky topics that at first seems simple and intuitive. We can even boil it down into quips like <i>survival of the fittest</i> or, more accurately, <i>descent with modification</i>. The problem is that simple processes can give rise to incredibly complex and (yes I'm going to be that nerdy) beautiful patterns that challenge our intuition.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is one of the reasons why <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php" class="uk-link-muted" target="_blank">misconceptions of evolution</a> are notorious challenges for high school and university education. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Recently some unpublished research made a big media splash because it claimed that a new, more contagious, strain of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) had been spreading. Evolutionary misconceptions became misinformation overnight. Thanks to an amazing community of scientists and science reporters, the claim was quickly addressed. One of my favorite articles is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-strains-transmissible/611239/" target="_blank" class="uk-link-muted">this peice</a> in The Atlantic by the amazing Ed Yong.

					</p>
					<p>
						A new <b>Genotype</b> is most likely increasing in frequency just because it happened to be the lucky one that started an outbreak in a new location. This genotype's lucky break is an example of something we call <b>Founder Effects</b> in ecology and evolutionary biology. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In this walkthrough, you'll watch an evolving pathogen spread into multiple locations right here in the browser so you can observe founder effects in action!

				    <p class="uk-text-lead" id="page7" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; repeat: true;">Descent with modification!</p>
				    <p>
				    	To get a visual sense of the evolutionary dynamics going on in the pathogen population, we'll create a network depicting the genetic relationships between pathogens. This <b>Phylogenetic Network</b> will show each <b>Descendant</b> (child) genotype connected to it's <b>Progenitor</b> (parent). 


				    	For starters, we'll seed the world with two distinct pathogen genotypes. Since we haven't enabled mutations yet, every new pathogen node is connected to one of the two introduced progenitors.
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	If you haven't already, try restarting the simulation and clicking the Infect Random Agent button several (>5) times.
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	You probably noticed that some of the nodes were more active than others in the phylogenetic network and ended up with larger clumps of descendants. Those were the lucky genotypes that by chance spread to more locations and produced more offspring. However, these genotypes are functionally identical to each other. In microbiology lingo, they different genotypes of the same <b>Strain</b>.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	Now let's turn on the mutations! 
				    </p>	
				    <p>
				    	Although we've enabled mutations, we're not changing any of the pathogen's biological features. We're not introducing any new strains. In fact, the only thing we're changing in this simulation is the color.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	Even so, you'll probably see what looks like a new strain spreading in the metapopulation! But, you're just seeing founder effects in action. 

				    </p>
				    
				    <p>
				    	Be sure to investigate how the amount of local and global movement affects the spread of pathogen mutants. For example, what happens at the two extremes of only local or only global movement? Remember, this is a stochastic simulation, so you'll have to run it a few times to get a sense of the range of possible outcomes. 
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	It's easy to imagine seeing these patterns and wanting to attribute them to functional adaptations. However, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, there's really no evidence that we're facing multiple strains. Of course, that might change. We're probably all getting used to feeling like things we learned a week ago are already outdated. But for now, we can get back to arguing about whether viruses are alive or not.
